# RQMC data for the melting of atomic hydrogen and deuterium

This repository contains the data and model for [this project](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.19484) on atomic hydrogen/deuterium. The `data` directory contains the datasets we used to train various models, for testing and final production. The `model` directory contains only the *final* model that we used for the path-integral simulations featured in the manuscript, which we referred to as QMC-MACE. Each directory also contains a python script as an example of how to use the data/model.
